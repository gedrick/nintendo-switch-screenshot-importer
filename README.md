# Nintendo Switch Screenshot Manager

## Automatically import your Switch screenshots and videos

Are you sick of manually copying and renaming files from your Switch's SD card? As someone who writes about video games quite often, I need to offload screenshots every week or so.

The results can be, well, frustrating to say the least, when you can't easily import your screenshots.

I created this tool so that I would have one-click access to all of my screenshots, whenever I needed them. You just need to set your SD card path and where you want to save the screenshots one time, and then you'll have one-button importing completely set up.
